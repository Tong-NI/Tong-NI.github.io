## Welcome!

I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://economics.smu.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">School of Economics</a> at <a href="https://www.smu.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Singapore Management University</a>. My research interests lie in **International Trade** and **Spatial Economics**.

My current work mainly studies how governments interact strategically with different policy instruments and how those interactions shape economic performance, climate outcomes, and welfare. Methodologically, I combine targeted empirical diagnostics with structural quantitative models, embedding micro-foundations and institutional details in general equilibrium frameworks to deliver transparent counterfactuals for policy evaluation and design.
<br>

**I am on the 2025-2026 Economics Job Market and available for interviews.**
