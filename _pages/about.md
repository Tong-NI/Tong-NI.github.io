## Welcome!

I am currently a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the [School of Economics](https://economics.smu.edu.sg/) at [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/). My research interests lie in International Trade, Urban and Regional Economics, and Applied Microeconomics.

I am on the 2025-2026 Economics Job Market and available for interviews.

You can reach me at [tongni.2021@phdecons.smu.edu.sg](mailto:tongni.2021@phdecons.smu.edu.sg) <br><br><br>
