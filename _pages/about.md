## Welcome!

I am currently a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://economics.smu.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">School of Economics</a> at <a href="https://www.smu.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Singapore Management University</a>. My research interests lie in **International Trade** and **Urban and Regional Economics**, with a focus on three broad themes: (1) trade and the environment; (2) trade policy and its welfare consequences; and (3) the spatial distribution of human capital. 

My current work mainly studies how regional and national governments interact strategically and how those interactions shape mobility, economic performance, climate outcomes, and welfare. Methodologically, I pair targeted empirical diagnostics with structural quantitative models, embedding micro-foundations and institutional details in general equilibrium frameworks to deliver transparent counterfactuals for policy evaluation and design.
<br>

**I am on the 2025-2026 Economics Job Market and available for interviews.**
