   <summary>Abstract</summary>
   The European Union (EU) has introduced the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to curb carbon leakage and incentivize global climate policy alignment. We develop a multi-country, multi-sector general equilibrium model featuring input–output linkages, carbon supply chains, and global emission externalities to evaluate the environmental and economic impacts of the EU's CBAM. Our results show that unilateral implementation modestly reduces global emissions due to carbon leakage through global energy markets. Global welfare improves marginally when environmental benefits are accounted for. When other countries respond optimally, strategic carbon policy adjustments under a non-cooperative Nash equilibrium enhance global emission reductions by mitigating both carbon leakage and free-riding. Under a cooperative equilibrium with Nash bargaining, multilateral negotiations yield substantial welfare and environmental gains, with the CBAM functioning as an effective enforcement device that raises the cost of disagreement and fosters deeper global climate cooperation.

   <summary>Abstract</summary>
   Non-cooperative tariffs change outside options and thus affect welfare outcomes in potential tariff negotiations. We focus on the U.S.–China trade war from 2018 through 2019 and examine whether such tariffs can serve as leverage to improve U.S. post-negotiation welfare. With a multi-country, multi-sector quantitative trade model, we simulate negotiations from two starting points: the 2017 baseline and the 2019 trade-war equilibrium. Our results show that, across reasonable estimates of U.S. bargaining power, imposing trade-war tariffs before the negotiations consistently enhances U.S. post-negotiation welfare.

   <summary>Abstract</summary>
   Higher education produces a mobile asset—skilled graduates—who may leave the jurisdiction where they were trained, making education a “leaky” investment for local governments. We develop a dynamic spatial life-cycle general equilibrium model in which individuals endogenously choose education and migration, while local governments allocate budgets and set admission policies. Quantified to the context of China, the model shows that the observed college expansion path reflects substantial underinvestment relative to a central planner benchmark, leaving large efficiency and equality gains unrealized. Underinvestment persists in a decentralized, locally funded Nash equilibrium, as provinces strategically free ride on inflows of graduates educated elsewhere and hold back their own investment, leading to national inefficiency. Optimal place-based strategies depend on development stage: advanced regions benefit from front-loaded education investment, whereas lagging provinces optimally delay investment until productivity and retention conditions improve.
